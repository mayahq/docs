title: Tutorial - Internal Tool
description: "A simple tutorial to make and test an internal tool to make a POST call to an HTTP endpoint"

In this simple tutorial, we introduce Maya by showing how you could build a simple internal
tool to enter data into a Google sheet using just natural language.

## Setting things up

Get a Maya API key in the web interface and set it up like this :

```
export MAYA_API_KEY = "mayakey-..."
```

Or set `mayalabs.api_key` to its value, in a file, like `main.py`:

```python main.py
import mayalabs

mayalabs.api_key = "mayakey-..."

```

We will also need a google sheet. Make a new one and give it two columns `Name` and `Email`.

## Writing data to the gsheet

### Drafting the script

The following script generates a program to write the variables `Name` and `Email` passed into it
to a google sheet.

```python main.py
script = """
1. write {{Name}}, {{Email}} to google sheet
"""
```

But this script isn't callable/testable from outside yet - we'll need to wrap with a receive and respond
steps to do so.

```python main.py
script = """
1. trigger on receive
2. write {{Name}}, {{Email}} to google sheet
3. send response back
"""
```

<Tip>
  You **don't need to replicate the exact syntax** of the steps above to get the
  same results. They should be just semantically similar i.e. be the _same in
  meaning in English_, and the PAC-1 interpreter should understand and adjust to
  the differences. For instance, the following will give the same result :
</Tip>

```python main.py
script = """
1. on receiving message, trigger
2. put into gsheet the fields {{Name}}, {{Email}}
3. send response
"""
```

### Initializing & updating the function

`mayalabs.Function` is a standalone object that encapsulates the script, the program graph generated from the script, auto-installed dependencies and dedicated compute required to run it. Functions have an unique property `name`, and can be reused using that.

```python main.py
# initialization
function_tool = mayalabs.Function(name="GsheetTool")

# linking the `script` with the function
function_tool.update(script=script)

```

### Calling the function

```python main.py

output = function_tool.call({"Name" : "Dushyant", "Email" : "Abc@c.co"})

```

Now `main.py` should like this :

```python main.py

import mayalabs

script = """
1. trigger on receive
2. write {{Name}}, {{Email}} to google sheet
3. send response back
"""

# initialization
function_tool = mayalabs.Function(name="GsheetTool")

# updating the `script`
function_tool.update(script=script)

#calling the function
output = function_tool.call({"Name" : "Dushyant", "Email" : "Abc@c.co"})
```

On running this python file, `python main.py`, the following should happen :

1. (_in parallel_) PAC-1 generates the program graph step-by-step
2. (_in parallel_) A compute runtime called a `Worker` is spun up to deploy the program
3. Dependencies are auto-detected and installed on the `Worker`
4. Maya indicates that Google Sheet authentication + URL is required to run, with link to set up

On securely logging in and setting the Gsheet URL we setup earlier, you can now run `python main.py` again, and it should add a new entry to the gsheet.

<Tip>
  We now have a script to write data into a google sheet in **four lines of
  code** that can _run anywhere_ - Maya abstracts away the code, dependencies
  and deployment, and centers focus on just naturally telling the machine what
  to do.
</Tip>

## Entering data using a form

Now that we have a basic script set up, we can change parts of it, and PAC-1 detects and deploys only the changes.

For instance, instead of calling it from within Python, say we need to spin up an interactive form with fields to enter data.

### Creating a form

Since the script is composable, we can just swap out the respond/receive bits, and put in a form step. For now, we can store this in a new script string `string_form` :

```python main.py
script_form = """
1. create a form with fields {{Name}} and {{Email}} as string
2. write {{Name}}, {{Email}} to google sheet
"""
```

### Updating the function

The same `Function` named **GsheetTool** can just be updated with this new script.

```python main.py
# initialization
function_tool = mayalabs.Function(name="GsheetTool")

# updating the `script`
function_tool.update(script=script_form)
```

Running `python main.py` again will update the function with this new script, and the form will be generated.

You can view and interact with the form by running `function_tool.show()`, which prints and URL where the form is hosted.

### Locking to prevent updates

The Python file in the current form will run the `.update` command everytime it's run, and will redeploy if changes are detected. To prevent this, call the `.lock()` method:

```python main.py
function_tool.lock()
```

Alternatively, unlock for updating and redeploying a modified script :

```python main.py
function_tool.unlock()
```
